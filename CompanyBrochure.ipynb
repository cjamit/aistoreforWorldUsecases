      "\n",
      "Why did we create an experiment tracking library when others exist? 3 reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Extensibility: libraries for experiment tracking often are not extensible: if you want to want or add a feature, track something completely new, or change the UI, you can't easily do it since the hosted piece is closed-source or at least not written in Python. Trackio is not a walled garden — fork it and change the Python code however you need and it'll work fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Local-first: You shouldn't need an account just to track and visualize metrics! We wanted to give ML practitioners a local-first option that allowed them to  track metrics privately. Of course, If you want to persist the logs or share the dashboard with others, you have the option to do that through Hugging Face datasets/Spaces with a single line of code.\n",
