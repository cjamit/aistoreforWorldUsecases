       "\n",
       "## 1. Nature of the Problem\n",
       "\n",
       "### Text-Based Data\n",
       "- **Is the problem primarily text-focused?**\n",
       "  - Examples: Customer support, content generation, sentiment analysis.\n",
       "  \n",
       "### Language Understanding\n",
       "- **Does the problem involve understanding or generating human language?**\n",
       "  - Tasks like summarization, translation, or Q&A are ideal.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Complexity of the Task\n",
       "\n",
       "### Clear Instructions\n",
       "- **Can the task be clearly defined?**\n",
       "  - LLMs perform better with well-defined prompts and clear objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Ambiguity\n",
       "- **Is the problem ambiguous?**\n",
       "  - If the problem has multiple interpretations, consider whether an LLM can handle this ambiguity effectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Data Availability\n",
       "\n",
       "### Quality of Data\n",
       "- **Is there sufficient and high-quality text data available for training or fine-tuning?**\n",
       "  - The more relevant data, the better the LLM can perform.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Privacy and Compliance\n",
       "- **Are there any data privacy or compliance issues?**\n",
       "  - Ensure that the data used complies with regulations like GDPR.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 4. Expected Outcomes\n",
       "\n",
       "### Performance Metrics\n",
       "- **What are the desired outcomes, and how will you measure success?**\n",

       "\n",
       "### Feasibility\n",
       "- **Is it feasible for an LLM to achieve the desired outcomes?**\n",
       "  - Consider benchmarks and case studies of similar applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Resource Availability\n",
       "\n",
       "### Technical Expertise\n",
       "- **Do you have access to the necessary technical expertise?**\n",
       "  - Implementation and fine-tuning of LLMs require expertise in machine learning and natural language processing.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Computational Resources\n",
       "- **Are the computational resources available for training or deploying the LLM?**\n",
       "  - LLMs can be resource-intensive, requiring powerful hardware or cloud services.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 6. Cost Consideration\n",
       "\n",
       "### Budget\n",
       "- **Is there a budget for implementing an LLM solution?**\n",
